# Recommendation Systems using Pyspark

In this exercise, I train the ALS model for recommendation on three different data sets using Pyspark. The virtual machine is hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Goal is to train the model and generate recommendations for different users and products.

Generating recommendations for:
1. Movies
2. Musical Instruments
3. Restaurants
