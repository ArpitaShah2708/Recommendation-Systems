## Data Scource

Data has been sourced through the following URLs:

1. Movie Ratings - Movie Recommendation from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/movie/data)
2. Musical Instruments Ratings - Product reviews from Amazon. (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)
3. Restaurant Data with Consumer Ratings - UCI Machine Learning Repository through Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/restaurant-data-with-consumer-ratings)

I downloaded these datasets and uploaded them to my storage bucket on Google Cloud. The data was then transferred to the virtual machine and accessed from there when running the codes.
